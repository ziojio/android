/**
 * Marks a method as an event subscriber.
 *
 * <p>The type of event will be indicated by the method's first (and only) parameter. If this
 * annotation is applied to methods with zero parameters, or more than one parameter, the object
 * containing the method will not be able to register for event delivery from the {@link EventBus}.
 *
 * <p>Unless also annotated with @{@link AllowConcurrentEvents}, event subscriber methods will be
 * invoked serially by each event bus that they are registered with.
